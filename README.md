# UFOs

Dana is a Data Journalist who is writing a piece about UFOs based in her hometown. This project utlizes tools such as Javascript and HMTL to create a webpage that will display all of the gathered information concerning UFO sightings. Using filters allows the user to access Dana's information in a smart and efficient manner.

## How to use the webpage:
The webpage is designed to allow the user to input on any of five filters in order to gather information on a specific subject.
The five filters are as follows:

The date of the sighting

The city where the sighting was located

The state of the sighting

The country the sighting was located in

The shape of the object that was seen

The input user can use one filter to find  list of avaliable information regarding that topic. For instance lets use the state filter for Florida:

Here we can see a list of sightings all from Florida, but we can filter even further if we like. Lets filter the city for "gulf breeze":

So using muliple filter fields allows the user to input more specific details concerning whatever topic they are researching.

## Things to fix
One of the largest drawbacks to these filters is the requirement to have case sensitive inputs. The filters should have a more general input value that would allow the code to read and determine the closest values to the user input. The filter for dates for example should be able to read just a day or a month or a year with only that input. Another possible addition could be more visuals. UFO sighting are in nature a visual product. If there is any photos or videos related to these sightings, it would definitely assist with the value the information is displaying.
